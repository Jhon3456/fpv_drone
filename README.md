This open-source project focuses on an FPV drone platform that combines vision-based tracking with long-range wireless control. The drone uses INAV as its flight controller firmware for stabilization and overall flight management, while a MaixCam (LicheeRV Nano) performs real-time object or person tracking. A custom transmitter based on ESP32 and a receiver using the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 communicate through LoRa SX1278 modules and use the iBus protocol for control signals. Tracking data is processed through a control law and converted into control setpoints, enabling automatic adjustments of yaw and pitch to follow targets while maintaining stable flight.
