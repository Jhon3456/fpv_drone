This project presents an advanced FPV drone platform designed for experimentation with stabilization, custom communication, and autonomous tracking. The drone integrates multiple onboard sensors to achieve stable and controlled flight, while a custom-built transmitter based on an ESP32 communicates with a receiver using a Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 and LoRa SX1278 modules.

A MaixCam, powered by the LicheeRV Nano architecture, adds onboard computer vision capabilities, enabling real-time object and human tracking directly on the drone. The system uses the iBus protocol for communication between components and applies dedicated control laws to support intelligent tracking and responsive flight behavior.

The main objective of this project is to merge FPV flight with embedded vision and custom electronics, creating a flexible platform for learning, experimentation, and research in drone control and vision-based navigation. 🚀
