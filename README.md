This open-source project focuses on an FPV drone platform that combines vision-based tracking with wireless control. The drone runs INAV for stabilization and flight control, while a MaixCam (LicheeRV Nano) performs real-time object or person tracking. A custom transmitter based on ESP32 and a receiver using Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 communicate through LoRa SX1278 modules and use the iBus protocol for control signals. Tracking data is converted into control setpoints through a control law, allowing the drone to automatically adjust yaw and pitch to follow targets while maintaining stable flight.
