This build is intended for the YSDIO F722 board.
This board is compatible with the AXISFLYINGF7PRO firmware; however, the drawback is that the gyroscope is configured with a 90° rotation, which does not match the physical orientation of the flight controller (FC).

As a result, the axis readings will be incorrect, negatively affecting the drone’s control.
Below are the steps required to correct the gyroscope orientation so that it matches the actual orientation of the FC.

STEP 1: Install necessary tools in WSL (only for Windows)

sudo apt update
sudo apt install git cmake ninja-build gcc-arm-none-eabi build-essential

STEP 2: Download INAV source code

# Go to C: drive
cd /mnt/c/

# Clone INAV repository from GitHub “Download the correct INAV version.”
git clone https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav.git

# Enter INAV folder
cd inav

STEP 3: Modify the target

# View available targets
ls src/main/target/

# Enter the target you want to modify
cd src/main/target/AXISFLYINGF7PRO

# Edit the configuration
nano target.h

#Go to line 52 and change:
#define IMU_MPU6000_ALIGN   CW0_DEG   // Depends on how the sensor is oriented in my case I choose (CW90_DEG) .
                                      // Possible values:
                                      // CW0_DEG   : no rotation
                                      // CW90_DEG  : rotated 90 degrees clockwise
                                      // CW180_DEG : rotated 180 degrees
                                      // CW270_DEG : rotated 270 degrees clockwise

Make your changes (pin mapping, features, etc.)
Exit: Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter

STEP 4: Configure build with CMake

# Create build folder
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure CMake with ARM toolchain
cmake -DTOOLCHAIN=arm-none-eabi ..

STEP 5: Compile only your target

cmake --build . --target AXISFLYINGF7PRO

STEP 6: Find the compiled firmware

# Search for the generated .hex file
find . -name "*AXISFLYINGF7PRO*.hex"

“STEP 7: Upload the new INAV HEX file”
