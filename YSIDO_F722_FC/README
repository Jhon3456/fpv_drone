This build is intended for the YSDIO F722 board.
This board is compatible with the AXISFLYINGF7PRO firmware; however, the drawback is that the gyroscope is configured with a 0° rotation, 
which does not match the physical orientation of (FC).

As a result, the axis readings will be incorrect, negatively affecting the drone’s control.

This process was carried out by installing Ubuntu on Windows (using a Linux environment) and performing the build and configuration from there.

The following steps describe how to modify the flight controller (FC) according to the desired configuration or 
the specific parameters that need to be changed.

STEP 1: Install necessary tools in WSL (only for Windows)

sudo apt update
sudo apt install git cmake ninja-build gcc-arm-none-eabi build-essential

STEP 2: Download INAV source code

# Go to C: drive
cd /mnt/c/

# Clone INAV repository from GitHub “Download the correct INAV version.”
git clone https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav.git

# Enter INAV folder
cd inav

STEP 3: Modify the target

# View available targets
ls src/main/target/

# Enter the target you want to modify
cd src/main/target/AXISFLYINGF7PRO

# Edit the configuration
nano target.h

//Go to line 57 and change this depending on the sensor used on the FC:
#define IMU_ICM42605_ALIGN   CW0_DEG    // Depends on how the sensor is physically oriented.
                                       // In my case, I chose CW90_DEG.
                                       // Possible values:
                                       // CW0_DEG   : no rotation
                                       // CW90_DEG  : rotated 90 degrees clockwise
                                       // CW180_DEG : rotated 180 degrees
                                       // CW270_DEG : rotated 270 degrees clockwise

Make your changes (pin mapping, features, etc.)
Save: Ctrl+O , then Enter, or Ctrl+S
Exit: Ctrl+X

# Return to INAV root
cd /mnt/c/inav

STEP 4: Configure build with CMake

# Create build folder
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure CMake with ARM toolchain (this step may take a long time)
cmake -DTOOLCHAIN=arm-none-eabi ..

STEP 5: Compile only your target This step can take a long time depending on your PC (up to 1 hour in my case).

cmake --build . --target AXISFLYINGF7PRO

STEP 6: Find the compiled firmware

# Search for the generated .hex file
find . -name "*AXISFLYINGF7PRO*.hex"

“STEP 7: Upload the new INAV HEX file”
